## About Me
I enjoy programming and I enjoy learning new technologies. I decided to create this blog because I wanted to be able to talk through projects as I begin working on them. And them be able to come back and look at the progress I have made and remember the process of going through the project as well. If I also happen to help someone else learn something along the way that's a bonus.
